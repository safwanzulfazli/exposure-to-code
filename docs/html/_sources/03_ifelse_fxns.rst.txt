Week 3: If/else, Functions
==========================

Outcome: Students will continue to learn basic control flow structures, specifically `if`/`else` statements. Students will also learn how to package repeatable code in functions.

.. Instructor notes
.. Message: Functions are really powerful when it comes to solving problems. Not different from copy-pasting code, but ease of use! Remember that code is to make things faster and easier! Writing good code makes you a lot more effective than writing bad code! 

What we will do: 
    * If, else and elif
	* Functions
	* Exercise: Quadratic solver
    * Exercise: Morse code reader
    .. * (Adv Exercise: Morse code writer)

If, else, and elif
------------------
.. Instructor notes: 
.. Estimated time: 20 mins
.. Section objective: 


.. [ ] In-class exercise: Nested ifs

Functions
---------
.. Instructor notes: 
.. Estimated time: 20 mins
.. Section objective: 

Exercise: Quadratic solver
--------------------------
.. Instructor notes: 
.. Estimated time: 20 mins
.. Section objective: 
.. [ ] Instructor solution on solving quadratic eqn. Takes a, b, c and outputs roots. Gotta try because not sure how the system deals w/ imaginary roots! 


Exercise: Morse code reader
-------------------------------
.. Instructor notes: 
.. Estimated time: 30 mins
.. Section objective: 
.. [ ] Instructor solution for taking in alphabets and translating them into Morse code. String samples can only contain alphabets and spaces. 

.. Write next few emails for the course in Morse code (???) 


.. Super secret advanced exercise: Morse code writer
.. -------------------------------------------------
.. Instructor notes
.. Estimated time: For students who finish 20 mins early
.. Section objective: 

.. [ ] Basically have students reverse the morse code decoder. 
.. [ ] Instructor solution needed to check that the morse code reader from above works!! 

Conclusion
----------
.. Instructor notes
.. Estimated time: <5 mins
.. Section objective: Recap and re-emphasize message
.. [ ] Recap and re-emphasize message of the day
