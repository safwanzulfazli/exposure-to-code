.. Instructor notes
.. Exercises that synergize w/ existing exercises in the class will be great! I see implementing a lotta if/elses and using pycosat for problems that can be SAT solvers to be a great example of difficult progression. 

Week 3: Advanced Exercises
==========================
Advanced exercises are designed for advanced learners that are ready to take on extra challenges. These exercises are made accessible to all after the class. Note that these exercises typically require more knowledge than what was presented in class.  

Adv Exercise: Finding Fibonacci numbers by recursion
----------------------------------------------------
.. [ ] Explain Fibonacci numbers
.. [ ] Explain the concept of recursive functions, getting a function to call itself
.. [ ] Problem statement: Find Fibonacci numbers up to N, using recursion

Adv Exercise : Solving sudoku with pycosat
------------------------------------------
.. warning :: Training wheels off! The material in today's class is not enough to solve this problem. 

.. [ ] Explain what sudoku is, and explain the procedure of solving it with logic
.. [ ] Solving sudoku w/ code is doable, link to Computerphile video on how they did it
.. [ ] In this case, use other approach - phrase as satisfiability problem
.. [ ] Explain satisfiability problems, and SAT solvers
.. [ ] Explain the formal CNF grammar used to phrase them
.. [ ] Problem statement (i): first on phrasing sudoku as CNF
.. [ ] (ii) Then calling the pycosat solver itself. Strongly inspired by pycosat's sudoku solver example.

You are expected to solve sudoku by deducing where to place the
