Week 3: If/else, Functions
==========================
Outcome: Students will continue to learn basic control flow structures, specifically `if`/`else` statements. Students will also learn how to package repeatable code in functions.

.. Instructor notes
.. Message: Functions are really powerful when it comes to solving problems. Not different from copy-pasting code, but ease of use! Remember that code is to make things faster and easier! Writing good code makes you a lot more effective than writing bad code! 

What we will do: 
    * If, else and elif
	* Functions
	* Exercise: Quadratic solver
    * Exercise: Morse code reader
    .. * (Adv Exercise: Morse code writer)

If, else, and elif
------------------
.. Instructor notes: 
.. Estimated time: 20 mins
.. Section objective: Introduce students to the concepts of if, else and elif
.. [ ] In-class exercise: Nested ifs

Functions
---------
.. Instructor notes: 
.. Estimated time: 20 mins
.. Section objective: 

Exercise: Quadratic solver
--------------------------
.. Instructor notes: 
.. Estimated time: 20 mins
.. Section objective: 
.. [ ] Instructor solution on solving quadratic eqn. Takes a, b, c and outputs roots. Gotta try because not sure how the system deals w/ imaginary roots! 

Exercise: Fizz Buzz
-------------------

Exercise: Morse code reader
-------------------------------
.. Instructor notes: 
.. Estimated time: 30 mins
.. Section objective: 
.. [ ] Instructor solution for taking in alphabets and translating them into Morse code. String samples can only contain alphabets and spaces. 
.. [ ] Instructor solution needed to check that the morse code reader from above works!! 
.. Write next few emails for the course in Morse code (???) 

Conclusion
----------
.. Instructor notes
.. Estimated time: <5 mins
.. Section objective: Recap and re-emphasize message
.. [ ] Recap and re-emphasize message of the day
